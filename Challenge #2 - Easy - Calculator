[easy] challenge #2
submitted 3 years ago * by nottoobadguy
Hello, coders! An important part of programming is being able to apply your
programs, so your challenge for today is to create a calculator application
that has use in your life. It might be an interest calculator, or it might be
something that you can use in the classroom. For example, if you were in physics
class, you might want to make a F = M * A calc.
EXTRA CREDIT: make the calculator have multiple functions! Not only should it
be able to calculate F = M * A, but also A = F/M, and M = F/A!

#Tip Calculator

def tip_amount():
    meal_total = input("Enter the price of your meal.")
    tip = 0
    total_cost = 0
    quality = input("How was your meal? Great, good, ok or poor?").lower()
    if quality == "great":
        tip = int(meal_total) * 0.2
        total_cost = int(meal_total) * 1.2
    elif quality == "good":
        tip = int(meal_total) * 0.15
        total_cost = int(meal_total) * 1.15
    elif quality == "ok":
        tip = int(meal_total) * 0.10
        total_cost = int(meal_total) * 1.10
    elif quality == "poor":
        tip = int(meal_total) * 0.05
        total_cost = int(meal_total) * 1.05
    else:
        print("Error => restart program")

    print("The tip amount is $",tip,", the total amount due is $",total_cost,".")
# TODO Ensure two decimals
# TODO Remove space after $
tip_amount()
